<h1> Last Train Home </h1>
<p>The Last Train Home documents the largest human migration. Over 130 million workers leave big cities and return home for the Lunar New Year. Often times the only chance they have to return home each year. </p>
<p>It's a compelling story that is full of stunning visuals, especially when capturing the overwhelming mass of people that work in China's big cities. A mass that is following a similar route as the family the filmmaker chooses to focus on as his main characters. </p>
<p>The filmmaker, Lixin Fan, no longer lives in China, but was born and worked there for many years as a journalist. A non-Chinese person could not have made this film. Profound intimacy was required, both with the culture and with the family. It would have been very difficult if the filmmaker didn't speak the same language as the family. A large crew would not be possible due to the topic of the film and the need to be very mobile in order to follow the family on the train ride. So to add a translator to the crew would have made it more cumbersome to make the movie. Also, a western filmmaker might have drawn too much attention and scenes in public could have resulted in too much staring by crowds.</p>
<p>The beginning of the story starts with the struggle the parents face, that we find out later happens each year, to purchase train tickets. It visually compelling and the filmmakers give just enough information on black slides with white texts to keep the audience curious. It's a great choice by the filmmakers to start with what I presumed to be the climax - the chaotic trip home. Later, surprising the audience with the actual climax- a family argument. </p>
<p>During the parents ride home the filmmaker gives the parents a chance to reflect on what's waiting for them. Children they have very little connection too and also who have a hard time accepting the authority of a parent they see only for a few days a year.</p>
<p>The one criticism I have is the timeline can be very confusing at times. Sometimes the filmmaker jumps days or months into the future and gives the viewer no indication that is happening. Eventually I understood the film encompasses several years and several trips home. It's also confusing when the daughter eventually makes her way to the city to also work in the garment industry like her parents since we never see her trip. However, it's easy to assume since life in the countryside and city look very different.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if black slides would help indicate large jumps in time would have helped or if part if the filmmaker wanted to emphasize the constant routine of it all. </p>
<p>The music for the most part wasn't distracting and I barely noticed it. Except after the daughter left a hair salon, the music was so different than what was used previously it was very distracting.</p> 
<p>I was surprised by the willingness and desire of the daughter to leave home and work in a factory. Despite admitting that she is tired all the time from garment sewing, she still prefers the big city and factory work to the countryside and school. </p>

Crunch time is beginning. It's been a bit stressful since we can't seem to find three strong characters that compliment each other. Three characters still seems a like a lot to fit into a short video. Especially since I picture the total documentary running 5 minutes or so. Three lives condensed? </p>
<p>We are finally getting into a shooting rhythm and shooting a lot. I think we will have our three characters collected by the end of the weekend. I like the direction we are taking with the film focusing on struggling female performers and female performers that know and support each other. I think if we can find ladies that know each other it will make for some intimate conversation. </p>
<p>I worry though our group just checking things off a 'list.' We need this, that and those. But not actually thinking about hanging out time. Which worries me that we might be forcing it a bit.</p>
<p>We filmed at a really neat club last night. Not too far away from the newsroom. It's in an interesting part of town, with a mix of people passing through or hanging out. It's in the loop and near the federal prison. Facing the right direction it feels miles away from downtown. </p>
<p>I'm still struggling to make the jump from still photography to video. What b-roll can be used to cover an interview? I agree it's odd to show video of someone talking but not show that conversation.</p><p> I made a short video and I like the beginning. And I know I don't have enough material from that night to make a story and the b-roll at the end while I really like it as b-roll it fits oddly in.</p>

<h1> Going Clear: Scientology </h1>

<p>The documentary, Going Clear: Scientology, attempts to break into the secretive world behind the religion of Scientology. The documentary is based on a book by Lawrence Wright, the lack of b-roll, a climatic event and a main character has resulted in a dull and slow documentary. The movie never attempts to break any stereotypes, leaving the viewer bored.</p>

<p>The Church of Scientology is a secretive place, so as a viewer I am not surprised by the lack of b-roll. So one has to give kudos for the b-roll the movie did find while doing through research. But it wasn't enough b-roll, so the director Alex Gibney needed to create b-roll. Near the beginning of the movie, the created b-roll was not distracting. It matched the sound bites and wasn't over-dramatic. It mostly visualized an e-meter used for auditing which is a central activity in Scientology. Choosing to create non-human items for b-roll was a good choice. Later however, b-roll scenes with people were used. These scenes were slightly out-of-focus, which was a seamless way to signal to the viewer that this was a recreation. However, these scenes still came across as very dramatic. </p>

<p>The biggest downfall of the movie and the reason I believe the movie was uninteresting to me was the lack of a revelation. The filmmaker never broke a stereotype. Coming into the film, my assumptions of Scientology was that it swindled people for money, evaded taxes and the leader like so many other leaders was a giant douche-bag. Evidently all of that was correct. Halfway through the movie I was tempted to turn it off, but only because I had to write this blog post I continued. </p>

<p>In the film Gibney interviews a handful of people, but it is not until the end that two main characters emerge. It's a bit confusing having many so lives and individual experiences to keep track of. The film would have been more interesting and powerful if Gibney choose a couple of people to concentrate on, thus being able to dive deeper into their experiences. The film never answered the question of why for me. Why did people join Scientology in the first place, what attracted them to it? One character says he joined Scientology to save his marriage, but that's the closet the film gets to explaining why people were joined the religion. Without this, it's hard for viewers to sympathize with the characters. Coming into the film, viewers probably wonder why anyone would even begin a relationship with Scientology. Without this answer the characters are too far removed from the viewers to elicit a link amongst them.</p>

<p>The interview sciences were well shot, with no distracting backgrounds and had motivated lighting. And Gibney did do a good job at the beginning using personal narratives woven together to tell a short history of the church. I did learn more about the details of L. Ron Hubbard life during the documentary; how he founded and spread Scientology. But the movie needed to either concentrate on one character so the audience could empathize with the characters or needed to include a climatic scene to keep the viewers engaged. </p>

<h1>Documentary Project</h1>

<p>I am really enjoying my new group. Marika and Grace are easy to work with and are definitely committed to the project. At first their topic was not that interesting to me, it feels a bit over done but the more we look for characters the more excited I get. After all, it's all about the character.</p>

<p>As a group we are getting a bit stressed during our search for a great character. After meeting with Audrey last weekend, Grace and I knew quickly she was not the right person for the role. She was open with her struggles, but it seemed she was already over the hump and the conflict was just not there anymore. I think it took meeting her and realizing she was not right for us to understand what we did need in a character.</p>

<p>I think we did find a compelling character in a poet and singer, Ito. There seems to be conflict at home, with her mother and brother. Her brother has taken the more traditional path and her mother really wants her to do the same.  Ito assures us that her brother and mother will be on board with this. </p>

<p>Ito opened up quickly to us during our meeting. Though I think she is still a bit hesitant but wants to share because she is at a point in her life where she wants to make a change. She wants to quit her job, to concentrate full time on her poetry and singing. She has yet to tell her mother, and has agreed to do this on camera. We also learned that Ito's father was an amateur poet, but never pursuing it as a career. Recent family conflict seems to have Ito protecting her mother. And perhaps feeling more sympathy to her mother's desires, since her father recently disappeared from her mother's life. This could be something to explore, maybe Ito sees security has something even more important now that she has seen her mom go through a time of uncertainty? </p>

<p>I see lots of b-roll opportunities: Ito at her job, performing, writing with partners and teaching. I'm curious how she does plan to support herself. </p>

<p>I think it was also interesting to explore Marika as a character. And producing that interview gave us a chance to work as a group and help define our roles within our group. However, Marika's story has little to do with our theme or topic we are interested in exploring. Having Marika in front of the camera, I hope will give us as a group the confidence to ask those hard questions, we asked Marika, to our future characters. </p>

<h1>The Times of Harvey Milk</h1>

<p>Rob Epstein made a very personal documentary with the film The Times of Harvey Milk. Though a work of advocacy for gay rights it doesn't stray away from all parts of Harvey Milk's character, good and bad. Epstein's spectacular choices of footage and interview subjects brings Milk's story to life despite him dying years before the making of the film. However, Epstein got off track during Dan White's trial moving the focus toward the injustice of the sentencing instead of Milk's vision.  </p>

<p>Epstein chose a range of characters for interviews and sound bites. His characters were interesting people that had a range of good and bad things to say about Milk. By including both negative and positive things about Milk, it prevents elevating Milk to a level that viewers cannot connect with. Milk's entire movement was encouraging gay and lesbian women to come out of the closet to make them real people to the community. If Epstein elevated Milk to martyr status this would take away from the Milk's message. </p>

<p>Epstein highlights this transformation, Milk was hoping to achieve by running for office, with the character of the union worker. The interview at the beginning of the movie with this character has a sound bite where he refers to Milk as a fruit. But as the documentary continues the audience witnesses the union worker's transformation. He realizes that gay people are no different than him. He later empathizes with Milk and his cause. Recognizing that if he himself never met Milk his views toward gays would not have evolved the way they did. This character is so important because his transformation validates Milk's cause and life and demonstrates Milk's success. </p>

<p>Epstein spends way too much time on Dan White's trial and his defense. The story for a brief moment becomes about White and the injustice of the jail time given to him. Taking this path has the potential to change the focus of the story. It's about Milk's life and advocacy. By focusing on the White, it distracts the viewers from Milk's story. </p>

<p>Epstein also chose to leave out from the story what others blame for the light sentence. Some jurors blame an incompetent prosecution for White's short sentence not Milk's gayness. By not offering both viewpoints, Epstein leaves a hole in the reporting of the story and potential damaging the film's credibility. Epstein should have presented both arguments and let the viewer decide. This would not have taken away from the film message. </p>

<p> Overall this was an incredible film. Despite that most of the movie was talking heads with b-roll, the movie was engaging and interesting the entire hour and half. It just goes to show that a documentary about the past can be captivating if the interviews are paired well with the b-roll. </p>

<h1>Documentary Project:</h1>

<p>This week I have been preoccupied by the election. I have been covering the 10th ward on Chicago's southeast side, Susan Sadlowski Garza is challenging the incumbent Alderman John A. Pope. The 10th ward is an economically depressed area, where jobs have vanished as the steel mills have closed. The area is no longer dependent on heavy industry for jobs and is beginning to fight back against the pollution heavy industry is causing. Recently unions have become under fire and right to work laws are becoming popular in states. Examining the state of unions in Illinois could be interesting. Especially since many are now becoming non-traditional environmentalists. Currently there is a strike at the BP plant on the border of Illinois. With the shrinking middle class are unions important today? </p>

<p> This weekend I am attending a coal field trip to southern Illinois sponsored by the Eco- Justice Collaborative. I will see what a reclaimed strip mine looks like, learn about coal processing and coal waste and meet people who have worked in the coal industry. This is a great time to meet and connect with people. </p>

<p> Rachel and I have talked about her interest in doing a story about violence in Chicago but if we do this we need to find a new angle, since so many stories have been done already about violence in Chicago. What about showing the after math of violence but talking with who is left behind to deal with it. The families forced to deal with the difficulties weeks or years after. Perhaps looking at two families, one on each side- one family dealing with a death, the other dealing with the criminal aspect. Is one harder, what is like for someone you love to commit such an awful crime? Do they support them, why? </p>
